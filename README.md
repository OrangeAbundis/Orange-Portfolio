# Orange-Portfolio

## Description

This project is meant to be a porfolio of the all the works i will work and have worked on. Not only will this be a library of sorts but it will be mainly a hub to update and post new projects to. In hindsight it would be very beneficial for this library to get bigger. Not only to showcase the projects but also to showcase the growth and expeience gained in working in this field.
