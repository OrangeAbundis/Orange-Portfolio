        <p>
            Hi, my name is Oscar. I'm a nerd at heart and a builder by nature. My favorite color is Orange. My favorite animals are dogs, parrots and ferrets. I'm a gamer. I like to play fighting games, turn-based strategy games, and even punishingly difficult single player games like Elden Ring. I'm fluent in English and Spanish. As for web design and computers, I've always had an interest in building software and computers themselves.

            <p>
                The Prework study guide was the first decent exposures to coding and building a repository on the web. It holds useful information that i still look back at time to use a reference.

                This was a collaborative project to make an application that would help the user decide on their next meal. Using parameters such as the cuisine, type of meal, type of diet, and allergens/intolerances. This uses apis suchs as spoonacular and nutrition ninja to help pull from a library of different food and recipe information.
