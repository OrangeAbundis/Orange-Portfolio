            Hi my name is Oscar. I'm a nerd at heart and builder by nature. My favorite color is Orange. My favorite animals are dogs, parrots and ferrets. I'm a gamer. I like to play fighting games, turned base strategy games, and even punishingly difficult single player ganmes like Elden Ring. I'm fluent in English and Spanish. I'm bit knowledgable in sigbn language and in college i took 2 years of Japanese. Not enough to hold a conversation but read and write im okay. As for web design and computers i've always help an interest in building software and computers themselves.

                The Prework study guide was the first decent exposures to coding and building a repository on the web. It holds useful information that i still look back at time to use a reference.
